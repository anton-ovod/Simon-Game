## Description

The Simon Game is a classic electronic memory game that tests your memory and sequencing skills. The game consists of four colored buttons that light up and produce a sound in a specific order. Your task is to remember the sequence and repeat it by clicking the buttons in the correct order. The game becomes progressively harder as you successfully complete each level by adding one more step to the sequence.

This implementation of the Simon Game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the jQuery library to handle user interactions and game logic.

## Features
